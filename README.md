# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Use the built-in scripts to install and start the repository right away. This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

# Documentation

Hi there and welcome to the React Unity WebGL Test repository! In this repository you'll find everything you'll need for testing and playing with the React Unity WebGL module. This repository is buildt using Create React App for a most basic boilerplate.

## Template Structure

Among this project you'll find three directories;

- "src" Containing the React Application here for you to test and modify
- "public" Containing the Static assets which includes the Unity WebGL build "unitybuild"
- "project" Containing the Raw Unity Project (not required but here for demo purposes)

## Usage for Module development

To use this repository for the module development of the React Unity WebGL module, you should remove the react-unity-webgl module using `npm remove react-unity-webgl` and install a manual build instead. For more details on building the module please head over to the React Unity WebGL [Documentation](https://github.com/jeffreylanters/react-unity-webgl#contribution-and-development) for further details on contribution, development and testing.
